# Perfect Note

A simple, yet fully featured text editor and notepad application for Android. Perfect Note provides note-taking and text editing capabilities, with support for a wide variety of formats and storage options. Format support includes plain text, Markdown, and more. Storage options include local device files, Google Drive, and more.


## Inspiration

Oddly enough, Perfect Note's primary design inspiration is the venerable Windows [notepad.exe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_%28software%29). After having used a number of different Android notepad applications over the years, none seem to provide Notepad's simple text editing experience. Beyond Notepad, Perfect Note is also inspired by [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [AK Notepad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akproduction.notepad&hl=en).
